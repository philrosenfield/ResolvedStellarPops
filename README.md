Notes
-----
This package was developed by Phil Rosenfield during his dissertation.
It is still under heavy development! Many codes are based on inputs and outputs
from MATCH (Dolphin 2002, 2012, 2013), TRILEGAL (Girardi 2005),
COLIBRI (Marigo 2013) and PARSEC (Bressan et al 2012). ALL of those codes are
propietary and besides a few header lines of output files, and formatting of
input files, none of their code exists here. This is the major reason this
package may not work right out of the box.
